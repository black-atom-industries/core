# Collection-Based Templates Migration Summary

## Overview
We have successfully migrated all adapters from individual theme templates to collection-based templates. This improves maintainability by reducing template duplication and makes the configuration more straightforward.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Changes
- Updated `adapter.schema.json` to define collection-based template structure
- Modified `validate-adapter.ts` to validate collection configurations
- Updated `template.ts` to process collection templates
- Updated `adapt.ts` command to handle the collection-based approach
- Updated documentation in `ADAPTER_DEVELOPMENT.md`

### 2. Adapter Migration
All adapters have been migrated to use collection-based templates:

#### nvim
- Created collection templates for all theme families (jpn, crbn, stations, terra)
- Updated adapter configuration to use collections
- Format: Lua collection templates

#### zed
- Created collection templates for all theme families
- Updated adapter configuration to use collections
- Format: JSON collection templates

#### wezterm
- Created collection templates for all theme families
- Updated adapter configuration to use collections
- Format: TOML collection templates

#### ghostty
- Created collection templates for all theme families
- Updated adapter configuration to use collections
- Format: CONF collection templates

#### obsidian
- Updated adapter configuration to use collections
- Format: CSS collection templates

## Benefits
1. **Reduced Duplication**: Instead of having identical templates for each theme in a collection, we now have a single template per collection.
2. **Simplified Configuration**: The configuration file is more concise and organized by theme collections.
3. **Easier Maintenance**: When updates to a template are needed, only one file needs to be modified per collection.
4. **Consistent Processing**: All adapters now use a uniform approach to templates.

## Remaining Tasks
- Remove redundant theme-specific template files from all adapters
- Test the adapt command on all adapters to ensure everything works as expected

## Troubleshooting
When running the adapt command, ensure it is run from the correct directory. If errors occur with finding theme modules, you may need to run the command from the core directory rather than the adapter directory.
